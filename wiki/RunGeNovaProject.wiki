=Run GeNova Project (For Mono in Windows)=


_*This text was translated from Portuguese (Brazil) into English with a translation tool google.*_


*1.* Get more mono updated on your machine (1.2.6). I suggest the folder: C: \ Program Files \ Mono


*2.* Get Mysql on your machine (5.0 +, I use 5.0). Once you install the tables you need to download the file: "MYSQL.txt scripts." The service needs of its Mysql runs when running the server.


*3.* Edit the file: "compiling project mono.bat." Set based on the folders in your computer. This. Bat used to compile the project and generate the. Exe.


*4.* Edit the file: "rotate server with mono.bat." Set based on the folders in your computer. This. Bat serves to raise the server.


*5.* Go folder. "\ Server\_GeNova_\Controllers", and open the file: "ControladorConexaoMysql.cs." In this file you edit the settings of Mysql according to your machine.


*PS1:* This explanation is based on mono, running via windows.


*PS2:* other configuration files you will see the site of the project, there at the end.


Do!
