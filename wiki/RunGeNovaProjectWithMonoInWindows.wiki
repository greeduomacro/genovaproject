=Run GeNova Project (For Mono in Windows)=


_*This text was translated from Portuguese (Brazil) into English with a translation tool google.*_


*1.* Get more mono updated on your machine (1.2.6). I suggest the folder: C:\Program Files\Mono


*2.* Get Mysql on your machine (5.0 +, I use 5.0). Once you install the tables you need to download the file: "scripts MYSQL.txt" The service needs of its Mysql runs when running the server.


*3.* Edit the file: "compilar projeto windows.bat" Set based on the folders in your computer. This. Bat used to compile the project and generate the. Exe.


*4.* Edit the file: "rodar servidor com mono.bat" Set based on the folders in your computer. This. Bat serves to raise the server.


*5.* Go folder ".\GeNova_XML\Configs", and open the file: "mysql.xml" In this file you edit the value settings of Mysql according to your machine.


*PS1:* This explanation is based on mono, running via windows.


*PS2:* other configuration files you will see the site of the project, there at the end.


Do!
