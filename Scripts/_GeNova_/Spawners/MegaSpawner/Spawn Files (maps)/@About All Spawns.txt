Here is a complete spawn package for Malas!

I would like to thank these people:
Morxeton - For making the Megaspawner
CWard - For his great megaspawner package
kilobit - For his reagent harvest files

I've used CWard's old megaspawner files for Malas but set them up for the new release of RunUO, and I've also made the dungeons smartspawning.

Files in this spawn package:
[list]
[*][B]Malas - Dungeons.msf - [/B]This file is the gem of the package! This file will "smart spawn" all the dungeons based off the CWards Spawn Package. "Smart Spawning" uses the proximity spawn feature & the despawn feature built in the Megaspawner system. The spawner's will trigger when any player withing 23 tiles walks near [If you want the spawner's to trigger when staff enter, just change the megaspawner settings]. 
So a player enters a dungeon and all the surrounding spawns 23 tiles away spawn automatically, which is roughly about 1.5 screens away.

The monsters have a respawn time of around 5-10min

Then after an hour of inactivity the spawners despawn. Having the dungeons use smart spawning lowers ingame mobile count, which in turn lowers world save time. The server no longer needs to remember thousands of monster stats & other information related to monsters.

[*][B]Malas - Dungeon Items.msf - [/B] This places a ankh and a trash barrel outside the dungeons.

[*][B]Malas - Outdoors.msf - [/B] This is a file that contains all the outdoor monsters and animals. Unfortunately smart spawning only works around 23 tiles from a player, so smart spawning in large out door areas is not possible.

[*][B]Malas - Towns.msf - [/B] Smart Spawned Town NPC's
